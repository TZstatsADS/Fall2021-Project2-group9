+ **Project summary**: Of all the data available on the [NYC Open Data By Agency](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/) website, as students we found ourselves most drawn to the data on education. We decided to monitor the change in frequency of [Applications for State Aid](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/Application-for-State-Aid/8gpu-s594). This data consists of a list of applications to receive aid, primarily aid in construction of damaged buildings or fixtures or to build new environments that would aid in education. This app consists of an interactive map showing the locations of each location filing for aid based on the selected time.
